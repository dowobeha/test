# Reading log

For each day of class, you are assigned reading(s) and/or video(s) to be completed prior to class.

Prior to class each day, you are required to record the degree to which you completed each reading/video.

You **will not** be graded on the degree to which you complete each reading/video, but you **will** be graded on whether or not you record this data prior to class.

For each reading/video, in the *Status* column, record the degree to which you completed that reading/video. Use the following codes:

| Code | Meaning                            | Will you receive credit |
|------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|
|  0   | You haven't recorded your status   |  No                     |
|  1   | You didn't do the reading/video    |  Yes                    |
|  2   | You briefly looked at some of it   |  Yes                    |
|  3   | You skimmed most or all of it      |  Yes                    |
|  4   | You completed at least most of it  |  Yes                    |
|  5   | You thoroughly completed all of it |  Yes                    |
